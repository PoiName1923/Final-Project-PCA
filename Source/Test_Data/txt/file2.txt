3 economic spotlight polish sanctions poland says u s sanctions have cost its economy billion dlrs and has made clear it wants washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms one banking source said but western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate they say it is blurred by the poor performance of poland s economy and dismiss the billion dlr figure as illusory sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under achieving they did have a bad effect yes but they only contributed to largely internal economic problems one said the u s imposed the measures and withdrew most favoured nation mfn trading status from poland in in retaliation for suppression of the solidarity free trade union under martial law the estimated cost to the polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the institute of national economy an offshoot of the central planning commission according to one western envoy an expert on polish economic affairs it extrapolated information on growth trends in trade with the united states as well as increases in credits from western commercial and government lenders but the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely he said dismissing the estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point which has no real scientific evaluation a foreign trade ministry official said polish exports to the u s in the late s averaged around mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed imports have suffered slumping from around mln dlrs to mln as credits ran out poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the west last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted billion official figures show acknowledging that sanctions have lost poland important u s markets including agricultural equipment textiles chemicals and some foodstuffs western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons poland is accusing the west of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons said one expert it s an illusion based on a misunderstanding of western economy there s a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it another said adding that poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the s which were no longer today s reality describing the billion dlr assessment as nebulous one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new mfn status will have little impact on poland which has a hard currency debt of billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry mfn doesn t really mean anything only that poland will not be treated worse than other countries it will be difficult to regain access to the u s market because different forces are in play now said one western envoy he said polish products were not competitive and their quality was too low trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the u s japan and europe would also hamper poland s efforts to regain entry deputy foreign trade minister janusz kaczurba recognised this fact recently kaczurba told the official pap news agency recently making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult and in certain cases impossible in a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about mln dlrs while poland is unlikely to seek compensation it says it has a moral right to assistance from the u s which it says imposed the sanctions illegally but a western economist said the argument that u s sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the polish economy won t cut any ice the americans will just reply that the poles acted immorally in crushing solidarity nevertheless polish national bank head wladyslaw baka in talks in washington last week with the international monetary fund imf and world bank made it clear that poland was looking for a lead from the united states he was quoted by pap as saying that poland would meet its financial obligations to the united states but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners he stressed that the u s had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of poland s partners interested in the settlement of polish debt putting it more sharply one senior banking official blamed washington for obstructing talks with the world bank imf and paris club of western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role as a major superpower the united states can influence international organisations he said citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which western nations were prepared to

7 bankers welcome spanish reserve requirement hike bankers welcomed the bank of spain s decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks saying it reflected the socialist government s determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity the central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to pct from march saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the bank which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth i think it s a good measure a senior foreign banker said it s a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy it shows that the political will is very strong they know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run he added the head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago the bank of spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates but bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now around eight pct for overnight funds was attracting money from abroad strengthening the peseta and making spanish exports less competitive the government says industry s competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation at pct last year the rate was way above that of spain s major trading partners in the european community which it joined a year ago to help meet this year s target of five pct it is insisting pay rises stay at that level setting the stage for clashes with trade unions who say they have made enough sacrifices demonstrations by workers students and farmers whose demands essentially involve more government spending have become an almost daily occurrence but prime minister felipe gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard the bank of spain which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to pct left it unchanged at today s auction the rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year when it was below pct bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months the measure will take effect tomorrow following the publication of the decree in today s official gazette bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and inevitably push lending rates higher a companion measure reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas also takes effect tomorrow officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates reuter
